In this GitHub repository, we will explain with a few words how to navigate our files.

File: CNN_with_fixed_LR.ipynb.
This Jupiter Notebook contains the code, that was used for training our CNN that had a fixed Learning Rate.


File: CNN_with_scheduler.ipynb.
This Jupiter Notebook contains the code, for the CNN with a scheduler, which refers to the model with a decreasing Learning Rate.

The code within the two Jupiter Notebooks are almost identically, with the exception of the change in two code-lines, containing the scheduler code.
